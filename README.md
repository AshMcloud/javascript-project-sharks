READ ME:

Hi sidenote to whom it concerns! Yes am aware this is nowhere near finished but with the missed deadline/extensions I've already had I thought it better to just submit this half finished and go from there. Will also email studentcare regarding this as my health has impacted my ability to work on this (and most things in life). Humbly javascript is worst than wet socks, thank you for taking the time to look at this train wreck of a project.
